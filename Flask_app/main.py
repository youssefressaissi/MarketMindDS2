# flask_app/main.py

# No imports or app creation needed here when using 'flask run' with the factory pattern.
# The FLASK_APP environment variable tells flask where to find the factory.

# The if __name__ == '__main__': block is only for running 'python main.py' directly,
# which we are NOT doing with the Docker CMD. It can be removed or left as is.
# For clarity, let's remove it for the Docker setup.
